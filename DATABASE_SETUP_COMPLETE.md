## 📱 Using Real Database Data in Your App

Your application now has two options for data:

### Option 1: Use Mock Data (Current)
- Your mock data functions in `src/lib/` still work
- Quick development and testing
- No database calls needed

### Option 2: Use Real Database Data
To switch to using real database data, update your API calls:

```typescript
// Instead of mock data
import { getAllEmployees } from '@/lib/employeeStore';

// Use database API
const response = await fetch('/api/employees');
const employees = await response.json();
```

---

## 🚀 Available Commands

```bash
# View database in visual Prisma Studio
npm run db:studio

# Push new schema changes to database
npm run db:push

# Seed with mock data again
npm run db:seed

# Reset database (warning: deletes all data!)
npm run db:reset

# Generate Prisma client
npm run db:generate
```

---

## 🔍 Next Steps

### 1. **Test Connection in Beekeeper Studio**
   - Open Beekeeper Studio
   - Use credentials above
   - Verify you can see all tables

### 2. **View Data in Prisma Studio**
   ```bash
   npm run db:studio
   ```
   - Opens visual database browser
   - Edit data directly
   - See all tables and relationships

### 3. **Connect Your App to Database**
   - API routes are ready in `/api/employees`, `/api/departments`
   - Update components to fetch from API instead of mock data
   - Data will be persistent across refreshes

### 4. **Add More Data**
   ```bash
   # Modify prisma/seed.ts
   npm run db:seed
   ```
